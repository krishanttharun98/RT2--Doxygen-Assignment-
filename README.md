- This assignment is done using Doxygen. [DOXYGEN](https://doxygen.nl/) is a documentation generator and static analysis tool for software source trees.

-  The first assignment consists of the documentation of the user interface of  RESEARCH TRACK 1 [(3rd assignment)](https://github.com/krishanttharun98/Research-track--1-thrid-assignment.git).

- The [DOCS](https://github.com/krishanttharun98/RT2--Doxygen-Assignment-/tree/main/DOCS) file consists of the documentation of code in the following formats [Latex](https://github.com/krishanttharun98/RT2--Doxygen-Assignment-/tree/main/DOCS/latex), [html](https://github.com/krishanttharun98/RT2--Doxygen-Assignment-/tree/main/DOCS/html) and [xml](https://github.com/krishanttharun98/RT2--Doxygen-Assignment-/tree/main/DOCS/xml).

###  *DOCUMENTATION*
#####  *GENERAL COMMENT  FOR THE ENTIRE CODE*
Usually, Doxygen is the standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources. So the code of RESEARCH TRACK 1 [(3rd assignment)](https://github.com/krishanttharun98/Research-track--1-thrid-assignment.git) is being commented to execute the documentation by using a specific format.

   
    /**
     * \file  : The description of the file needs to be commented
     * \brief : Brief description of the code is commented 
     * \author: KRISHANT THARUN 5168143
     * \Entire code is being commented 
    **/
    code goes here....

#####  *DOXYWIZARD*
 Doxywizard is used for creating and editing configuration files that are used by doxygen. Doxywizard consists of a single executable that, when started, pops up a window. 

![DOXYWIZARD](https://doxygen.nl/manual/doxywizard_main.png) 

After entering the details in the doxywizard then the Doxygen executes the files documentation in the preferred format. The documented output of the code is being stored in the file [DOCS](https://github.com/krishanttharun98/RT2--Doxygen-Assignment-/tree/main/DOCS). The DOCS file consists of the documentation of code in the following formats [Latex](https://github.com/krishanttharun98/RT2--Doxygen-Assignment-/tree/main/DOCS/latex), [html](https://github.com/krishanttharun98/RT2--Doxygen-Assignment-/tree/main/DOCS/html) and [xml](https://github.com/krishanttharun98/RT2--Doxygen-Assignment-/tree/main/DOCS/xml).

_TASK:_
Perform a statistical analysis on the first assignment, considering two different implementations (yours, and a given solution:[CarmineD8/python_simulator](https://github.com/CarmineD8/python_simulator/tree/rt2) and testing which one performs better in 
the circuit given, when silver tokens are randomly placed in the environment.
As performance evaluators you may possibly consider:
- the percentage of crashes / collisions with the walls / robot going in the wrong direction 
- the average time required to finish the circuit
- the distance from the obstacles

_CODES:_
- My implementation is taken from the  [RT1-assignmnet-1](https://github.com/krishanttharun98/turtlebot.git).
- Professor's code is taken from [CarmineD8/python_simulator](https://github.com/CarmineD8/python_simulator/tree/rt2).
